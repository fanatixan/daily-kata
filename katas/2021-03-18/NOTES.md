# Notes

## Legend

- âš  TODO
- ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS
- âœ… DONE

## Plans

- boundaries
  - all numbers will be valid
  - at least one number will be present
  - numbers will be separated with a single space
- validation
  - no validation is required, the input will be valid (see boundaries)
- âœ… edge cases
  - âœ… single number -> return it as both max and min
- âœ… general cases (number `A` is greater than number `a`)
  - âœ… `"A a"` -> `"A a"`
  - âœ… `"a A"` -> `"A a"`
  - âœ… multiple numbers -> `"max min"`

## Techdebt
- repetitive code
- hard to read
